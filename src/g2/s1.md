### Time Complexity

- `O(n)`, where n is the number of character in the input string

Needs at most one full scan of the characters inside the input

### Space Complexity

- `O(n)` in worst case, where n is the number of character in the input string

The worst case occurs when an input contains opening parentheses only (e.g. `{[([`). This requires the buffer to keep each parentheses until in the input is deemed invalid.
